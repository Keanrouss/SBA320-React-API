This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Using react-router to generate routes to display result. After typing a city, click the "5 day forecast" to see the next upcoming 5 days forecast for the selected town.


## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
